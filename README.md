## ✨ About the Project

SkillCinema is a modern Android application built with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**, designed to provide a smooth and engaging movie-browsing experience.
The goal of the project is to explore professional Android development practices — clean architecture, modular UI, scalable data flow, and modern Jetpack components.

## ⚙️ Technology & Architecture

### 🔧 Core Technologies

* **Kotlin** — primary programming language
* **Jetpack Compose** — declarative UI framework
* **Jetpack Components:** ViewModel, Navigation, Room/DataStore
* **Networking:** Retrofit or Ktor (depending on module)
* **Asynchronous processing:** Coroutines & Flow
* **Dependency Injection:** Hilt or Koin

### 🧩 Architecture

Follows the **MVVM pattern** to separate responsibilities clearly:

| Layer         | Responsibility                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Model**     | Data storage, API responses, local DB |
| **ViewModel** | UI state management, business logic   |
| **View**      | Compose UI rendering                  |

This makes the project more maintainable, testable, and scalable.
